# node API Example

## Overview

This repository serves as an illustrative example of a node API that demonstrates the implementation of various key features and technologies. It showcases the use of design patterns, dependency injection, middleware, JWT (JSON Web Token) authorization, ORM, Logger. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn these concepts or an experienced developer seeking a reference, this project can serve as a valuable resource.

## Features

- **Design Patterns:** The project integrates well-established design patterns to promote code reusability, maintainability, and scalability.

- **Dependency Injection:** Utilizes the built-in dependency injection for managing object lifetimes and promoting loosely coupled components.

- **JWT Authorization:** Implements JWT-based authentication and authorization for securing API endpoints.

- **ORM:** Utilizes ORM for data access, providing a robust and efficient way to interact with the database.

- **Localization:** Implements Accept-Language in header for Localization.
